> This was an excellent piece of work. You have covered all aspects of the specification. Really great that you utilised Spark as well as CouchDB. The scripting and auto-scaling features were excellently done - both at the infrastructure side as well as the container side through use of Docker SWARM. The user interface was excellent and the report covered all aspects of the work in detail. Nice idea to have a token database for Twitter harvesting. It was a very nice touch to describe the actual process in development and meetings that were taken and the fact that you had minutes of the meetings in your code repo was great. A minor point is that you should remove the commented out code in the final repo that you submit. You should also add more comments to the code. You did not say anything regarding the disadvantages of MRC - presumably your team faced no issues in this regard, although I note that you identified numerous challenges throughout, e.g. harvesting tweets. Great attempt!!!
